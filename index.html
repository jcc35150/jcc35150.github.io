<h3>Recap of the Falcons Losses</h3>
<p>The Falcons entered the season as one of the best teams in the NFL. They made it to the Superbowl
the year before and have an MVP quarterback in Matt Ryan. Their struggles this season have been unexpected.</p>
<p>Although the Falcons started off their season with a win against the Bears, they were expected to blow the bears out, the bears are a terrible team and many saw the small victory as an issue.</p>
<p>The Falcons seemed to continue on the right track by the beating the packers at home, however the Packers were without 
Aaron Rodgers at the time and without him the Packers are a very different team.</p>
<p>The Falcons since that game have gone down hill. Thy lost to the Bills, Dolphins and should have lost to the Lions. Although they have won 50% of their games, they have barely beaten some oh the worst teams in the NFL and have lost to the other bad teams.</p>

<h3>What can they do?</h3>
	<p>Although the falcons have been struggling recently,there is alot they could do the help their chances of winning the games.</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Getting Julio Jones Involved</li>
		<li>Having MVP Matt Ryan play like an MVP
			<ol>
				<li>Matt Ryan is Averaging 67% completion</li>
				<li>He has had one 300 yard passing game</li>
			</ol>
		<li>Devonte Freeman is under utilized</li>
		<li>Sarkisian's play calls are predicatable</li>
	</ul>
<div style=text-indent:50px> In terms of breaking down what is listed up above, getting Julio Jones involved is first on the list for a reason.Julio is the best wide reciever in the NFL yet he has not had a single touchdown catch this season. Some might point fingers at Matt Ryan not throwing him the football. As a matter of fact 
<b> Matt Ryan is an Elite Quarterback.</b>
 There I said it. Although he
 is usually the scape-goat about why Atlanta has a bad season, he literally was the MVP last season. He is also the fastest player to reach 40,000 yeards of offence.
 Although Matt is an MVP quarterback he has still had a below average season. He has complete 67% percent of passes which is good, but low for him. He has also only had one 300 yard game. This high copletion percentage but low total yardage alludes to the falcons not connecting on the deep ball, where Julio usually thrives.
 More over, Devonte Freeman is a all-pro running back who is having a career low in touches per game. He isn't running the ball leading defenses to play farther back, which allows them to shut down the deep ball.
 This all points to Steve Sarkisian's play calling. As a first year offensive coordinater for the Falcons, Sarkisian has been awful. His play calling has been so predicatable that the defense has been able to load up the box if there is a run or drop the line backers into coverage when the Falcons throw. If Sarkisian is able to start confusing defense, Julio Jones will find himself open more often which will open up holes for Tevin Coleman.</div>
<p>Even though Falcons are having a rough year, the same was happening last season. Last season the falcons had 30/1 odds of making it to the superbowl after five games with their 1-5 record. The Falcons still have the bability to turn the season around. The combination of Julio Jones, Tevin Coleman, and Matt Ryan is a lethal combo that is fun to watch. Regardless of how the flacons finish, it is highly recommended that you buy tickets to watch the falcons.</p>
